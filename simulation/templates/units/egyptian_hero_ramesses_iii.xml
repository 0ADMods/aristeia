    <History>Ramesses III is widely considered to be the last great New Kingdom Pharaoh. He was beset by invasions of Sea Peoples and Libyans during his reign, and he defeated a major invasion of Sea Peoples at the Battle of the Delta by using a combination of Egyptian naval tactics and massed shore-stationed archers.</History>
