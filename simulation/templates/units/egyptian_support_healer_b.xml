    <History>In theory, the Pharaoh was the chief priest in Egypt (one of his titles was “High Priest of Every Temple”), but in practice he employed a class of powerful priests who would attend to the religious affairs of the nation. Priests also served as magicians and healers; the Egyptians were famous for their relatively advanced medicine.</History>
