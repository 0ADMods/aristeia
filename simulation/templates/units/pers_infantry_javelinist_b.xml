    <History>Sparda was the name given to the Achaemenid satrapy in western Asia Minor that replaced the Kingdom of Lydia after the conquests of Cyrus. The peoples of Phrygia, Mysia, Paphlagonia, and Pisidia supplied the empire with much of its skirmish force during this period. Takabara was a blanket term used to describe the Achaemenid auxiliries and derived originally from the Iranian crescent shield. Javelin throwers were an important arm of the Persian infantry, giving added close range punch to the archers and able to close with the enemy if necessary.</History>
