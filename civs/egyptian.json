After a victory, they were permitted to cut off the hands of enemy corpses and turn them in to the scribes, both for overall tallying purposes and for ascribing honour to the fortunate soldiers who were able to deliver large numbers of hands. Usually, only the hands of enemies of significantly lighter or darker skin tones than themselves were accepted (perhaps because promotion-hungry soldiers may have otherwise been tempted to mutilate their own dead).",

				{
					"Name":"Thutmose I",
					"History":"Thutmose I was a popular Pharaoh, a commoner by birth who had been a general of Ahmose, and he married into the royal family. Three of his offspring were Neferukheb, Hatshepsut, and Thutmose II. He engaged in a great deal of rebuilding, and commenced work on the Temple at Karnak. Early in his reign, Thutmose defeated the Nubians and established a vice-royalty in their land entitled the 'King's Son of Kush.' He also led campaigns east of Egypt to subdue some of the old foes that he and the Israelite monarchy had in common. One of these campaigns is recounted in I Kings 9:16: 'For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.' This 'daughter of Pharaoh' who married Solomon (who had 'made affinity' with Pharaoh) was in all likelihood Neferukheb (or Nefrubity), who receded from Egyptian records thereafter."
				},
				{
					"Name":"Hatshepsut",
					"History":"Hatshepsut is probably the most well-known of the female Egyptian Pharaohs; by rebuilding trade networks with Phoenicia and Israel that had been severed during the Hyksos occupation of Lower (northern) Egypt, she helped usher in the prosperity of the New Kingdom. Hatshepsut was probably the Queen of Sheba mentioned in the Scriptures as visiting King Solomon of Israel. She also appears to have led several successful military campaigns in Nubia. II Chronicles 9:1: 'And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.'"
				},
				{
					"Name":"Thutmose III",
					"History":"Upon his step-mother Hatshepsut's death, Thutmose became Pharaoh and soon set to work regulating internal affairs as well as preparing to launch ambitious campaigns of conquest. Thutmose, later dubbed the 'Napoleon of Egypt', eventually ruled an area of territory spanning from the Fifth Cataract of the Nile to the Euphrates River. Thutmose's campaigns included two forays into the Levant, the first of which involved the famous Battle of Megiddo in Judah, and the second of which involved the seizure of the Jerusalem Temple's treasures. Thutmose recorded the plunder on the walls of Karnak. II Chronicles 12:2-4 & 9 states, 'And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the Lord, with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.... So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.'"
				},
				{
					"Name":"Seti the Great",
					"History":"After a period of international regression for Egypt, Seti reversed affairs by extending the Egyptian empire through the regions of Canaan (or Retennu) and Syria once more, inflicting defeats on the Hittites in the process. Seti recorded his campaigns in the Temple of Karnak. He also constructed several monuments at Abydos and Thebes."
				},
				{
					"Name":"Ramesses II the Great",
					"History":"'They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.' (Jeremiah 46:17). Widely regarded as one of the greatest Pharaohs, though perhaps in large measure because his self-promoting efforts succeeded so well, Ramesses II nonetheless brought Egypt to great heights of military prowess, although he very nearly met disaster in the famous Battle of Kadesh against the Hittites, with whom he afterwards concluded an historic peace treaty. Jeremiah 46:3-6 states, 'Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines. Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the Lord. Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.'"
				},
				{
					"Name":"Ramesses III",
					"History":"Ramesses III is widely considered to be the last great New Kingdom Pharaoh. He was beset by invasions of Sea Peoples and Libyans during his reign, and he defeated a major invasion of Sea Peoples at the Battle of the Delta by using a combination of Egyptian naval tactics and massed shore-stationed archers."
