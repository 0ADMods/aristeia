Step 3.
----

Launch 0ad with this mod. Instructions on how to do this depend on your operating system.
In the 0 A.D. main menu go to Tools & Options > Mod selection. Activate your mod there and press 'Start mods'. When the game is restarted you should be able to see Aristeia's customized main menu. If that is not ther case, you probably did something wrong :).
